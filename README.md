# financial-fraud-detection-with-ai
A deep learning-based system for detecting financial fraud using transaction data. Achieves 94%+ accuracy with real-time detection capabilities and privacy-preserving considerations.

# Financial Fraud Detection with AI

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting fraudulent financial transactions using AI. Leveraging real-world transaction data, the model is trained and optimized to achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall. The system is designed to operate in real-time with integration capabilities via APIs and includes considerations for data privacy and bias mitigation.

## üîç Features

- Preprocessing with RobustScaler to handle outliers
- Feature engineering with one-hot encoding and column selection
- Addressing class imbalance through undersampling
- Deep Neural Network model using TensorFlow and Keras
- Evaluation with F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Prototype deployment via API for real-time fraud detection
- Fairness and privacy strategies like federated learning

## üß† Model Architecture

- Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Final output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

## üìä Results

- **Accuracy:** 94%
- **F1-score:** 0.95
- **Precision & Recall:** High values for both fraud and non-fraud classes
